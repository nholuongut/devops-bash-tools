usage_description="
Normalizes a Spotify playlist filename provided as arg(s) or stdin to an original playlist name

This is used because playlists with slashes have them converted to unicode equivalent by spotify_playlist_to_filename.sh, so when searching for playlists in spotify_playlist_name_to_id.sh, I use this script to reverse the process to allow for using auto-completed filenames as playlist names and still having everything resolve correctly
